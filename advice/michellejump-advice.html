			<h4>Experience is key, not a degree!</h4>
			<p>I've been working for a long time, and I've been looking at how to transition into tech - particularly back-end development.</p>

			<p>I thought the best way to get credibility was the long and hard way - doing a degree, part-time, while working full-time and being a caregiver. This would take around seven years, but I got started and optimistically thought that doing my programming papers would lead to a junior developer. It didn't.</p>

			<p>Two years, thousands of dollars and hundreds of study hours later, and aggravating employers with the need to take time off around assignment time, I still hadn't got a role in tech.</P>

			<p>So I decided to revisit my plans. How to actually get a role in tech and development?</p>

			<p>The answer is - practice. Practice, experience, patience and tenacity, over a period of time.</p>

			<p>A degree is a wonderful thing, and I will go back to mine, but it may not necessarily be the door to open a new career up.</p>

			<p>That's why, after a two year absence, I've come back to Skillcrush, and put my degree on hold for a while.</p>

			<p>In two months of a Blueprint, I've learned so, so much more - in much less study time! - than I did spending 20 hours a week studying and burning myself out. :)</p>

			<p>I can have a life, have fun learning to code, spend a fraction of the money investing in my education (and have lifetime access to the course content instead of just a year),
				not burn myself out, and gain valuable experience - all while being flexible and not having to worry about assignment extension requests and taking time off work to study.</p>

			<p>So my advice would be - if you want to be a developer, get the practical skills first - degree second! :) Build your portfolio site and Github account, and just keep going!</p>

			<p>I'm not going to spend six or seven exhausting years to not get the job I want - I'm going to study with Skillcrush (and others), get career coaching, and get the career I'd love to have. :) </p>

			<p>Then, when I'm ready, and have flexibility with my work, I'll go back and finish my degree - because I want to, not because I have to.</p>

			<p>Keep going!!! Skillcrush is the perfect starting point to get you firmly on the right path with your new career. It takes time, but you WILL get there! :) And so will I. </p>
